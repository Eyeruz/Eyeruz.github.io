I always found coding to be cool, but I never thought I’d go to coding school and make a career out of it, I remember when I use to change up the codes on my tumblr account to make it look pretty.. I would literally sit for hours trying to make my page look perfect. I love coding, I love that it challenges me and works my mind & I also love the fact that its always changing and you’re always learning.. the more I code the more I grow a passion for it. I was feeling a bit unfulfilled in my life and had no idea where it was going.. i didn’t know what i wanted to do and i was feeling like a bit stuck. My cousin called me a couple of months ago and told me about a friend of a friend who went to a bootcamp and got a good job and completely changed her life around. I didn’t think much of it at first cause I felt like I’m to old to go back to school and had no desire to do so, but for some reason it always stayed in the back of my mind. So I started researching online and came across a couple of free online courses like w3schools and gave it a try and fell in love. And of-course watched endless youtube videos of peoples journey in bootcamps. Finally I started looking at schools and I decided flatiron was the best way to go. This is a start of a whole new life for me I’m looking forward to making this a life long career.
