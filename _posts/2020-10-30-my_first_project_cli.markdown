I was both excited and nervous to begin this project.. i didn’t know what to expect. When i started i was looking at a blank page with no tests to run telling me what to do step by step, i was intimidated.. everything i knew seemed to fly out of my mind… with my heart raising and my mind scattered i started looking up APIs i wanted to do my project on. It wasn't hard to make my mind up on what my project was going to be about.. and with little to no effort i found the perfect API on my first google search.. “The Cat API” and so it began.. with attending every single office hour on zoom, asking away at questions and literally spending every waking hour staring at my screen.. (no exaggeration when i say every waking hour) i finally finished. I say that that with such ease but it was anything but easy.. that term “easier said than done” really holds weight to this journey.. it started off hard.. and when some of my classmates were done with the project when i barely began definitely made me feel like i was falling behind.. there were days i thought i wouldn't finished on time.. knowing that it’s finally over makes my eyes water a little. In the middle of the project i started to gain a little faith.. “well…this isn’t so bad” i started to think to myself, and before i knew it i was having fun.. I started to feel like i was made for this lol.. definitely a roller coaster of emotions but the ending was filled with feelings of joy and accomplishment I'm so proud of myself for not giving up..i know my hard work will pay off. :)
