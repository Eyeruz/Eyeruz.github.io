WOW! I loved this.. i felt like a software engineer working on this project it definitely felt very “real”.. I did my project on an online store.. (“many to many relationship”). Starting the project was really easy.. the concept of get and post wasn't hard to grasp.. then I got to patch and delete and it wasn’t so “easy” anymore.. I definitely started to feel like I bit off more than I could chew when I added the feature of adding more than one time in the cart.. I wanted to rake db:rollback and start the whole thing over again lol… definitely regretted doing a “many to many relationship”, but after countless rake db:rollbacks and going back forth with myself about the deleting the quantity feature i finally decided to keep going and I’m so glad i did because I learned soooo much.. one of the biggest motivations was when my instructor told me my project is good enough to pass the next one.. that line alone made me feel like I’m not dumb lol… I asked a lot of questions and people are very helpful and i’m so thankful for all the help i received doing this project because I would not have able to complete it. And also i wanna take the maker of coffee.. I spent a lot of time working on this project.. lots of late nights.. and omg the sun is coming up moments, lol but it's finally done and i’m so glad.. looking forward to a full night of sleep where i don’t wake up at 3am from nightmares that my code isn’t working lol.
